# Misinformation campaign analysis

Extract data from from social media images and texts in disinformation campaigns.

**_This project is currently under development!_**

Use the pre-processed social media posts (image files) and process to collect information:
1. Text extraction from the images
1. Improving the preparation of the text for the data analysis (e.g., text cleaning)
1. Performing person and face recognition in images, facial expressions recognition, as well as the extraction of any other available individual characteristics (e.g., gender, clothes) 
1. Extraction of other non-human objects in the image
1. 5-Color analysis of the images
  
This development will serve the fight to combat misinformation, by providing more comprehensive data about its content and techniques. 
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a computer-assisted toolset to investigate the content of disinformation campaigns worldwide.
