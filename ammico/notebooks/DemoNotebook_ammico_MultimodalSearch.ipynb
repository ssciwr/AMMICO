    "You can run this notebook on google colab or locally / on your own HPC resource. The analysis can be quite slow on the google colab default runtime. For production data processing, it is recommended to run the analysis locally on a GPU-supported machine. You can also make use of the colab GPU runtime, or purchase additional runtime. However, google colab comes with pre-installed libraries that can lead to dependency conflicts. The setting on google colab changes frequently, so it is only ensured that this demonstration notebook runs on the default runtime. \n",
