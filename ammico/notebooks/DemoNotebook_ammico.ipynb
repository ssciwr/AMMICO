The translated text is cleaned of whitespace, linebreaks, and numbers using Python syntax and spaCy. The user can set if the text should be further summarized, and analyzed for sentiment and named entity recognition, by setting the keyword `analyse_text` to `True` (the default is `False`). If set, the transformers pipeline is used for each of these tasks, with the default models as of 03/2023. Other models can be selected by setting the optional keyword `model_names` to a list of selected models, on for each task: `model_names=[\"sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6\", \"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\", \"dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english\"]` for summary, sentiment, and ner. To be even more specific, revision numbers can also be selected by specifying the optional keyword `revision_numbers` to a list of revision numbers for each model, for example `revision_numbers=[\"a4f8f3e\", \"af0f99b\", \"f2482bf\"]`.\n",

Initially, it is detected if faces are present on the image using RetinaFace, followed by analysis if face masks are worn (Face-Mask-Detection). The detection of age, gender, race, and emotions is carried out with deepface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the features found on the image, the face detection module returns a different analysis content: If no faces are found on the image, all further steps are skipped and the result `\"face\": \"No\", \"multiple_faces\": \"No\", \"no_faces\": 0, \"wears_mask\": [\"No\"], \"age\": [None], \"gender\": [None], \"race\": [None], \"emotion\": [None], \"emotion (category)\": [None]` is returned. If one or several faces are found, up to three faces are analyzed if they are partially concealed by a face mask. If yes, only age and gender are detected; if no, also race, emotion, and dominant emotion are detected. In case of the latter, the output could look like this: `\"face\": \"Yes\", \"multiple_faces\": \"Yes\", \"no_faces\": 2, \"wears_mask\": [\"No\", \"No\"], \"age\": [27, 28], \"gender\": [\"Man\", \"Man\"], \"race\": [\"asian\", None], \"emotion\": [\"angry\", \"neutral\"], \"emotion (category)\": [\"Negative\", \"Neutral\"]`, where for the two faces that are detected (given by `no_faces`), some of the values are returned as a list with the first item for the first (largest) face and the second item for the second (smaller) face (for example, `\"emotion\"` returns a list `[\"angry\", \"neutral\"]` signifying the first face expressing anger, and the second face having a neutral expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "The emotion detection reports the seven facial expressions angry, fear, neutral, sad, disgust, happy and surprise. These emotions are assigned based on the returned confidence of the model (between 0 and 1), with a high confidence signifying a high likelihood of the detected emotion being correct. Emotion recognition is not an easy task, even for a human; therefore, we have added a keyword `emotion_threshold` signifying the % value above which an emotion is counted as being detected. The default is set to 50%, so that a confidence above 0.5 results in an emotion being assigned. If the confidence is lower, no emotion is assigned. \n",
