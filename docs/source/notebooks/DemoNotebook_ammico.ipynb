The detection of age, gender, race, and emotions is carried out with deepface.\n",

    "Depending on the features found on the image, the face detection module returns a different analysis content: If no faces are found on the image, all further steps are skipped and the result `\"face\": \"No\", \"multiple_faces\": \"No\", \"no_faces\": 0, \"wears_mask\": [\"No\"], \"age\": [None], \"gender\": [None], \"race\": [None], \"emotion\": [None], \"emotion (category)\": [None]` is returned. If one or several faces are found, up to three faces are analyzed if they are partially concealed by a face mask. If yes, only age and gender are detected; if no, also race, emotion, and dominant emotion are detected. In case of the latter, the output could look like this: `\"face\": \"Yes\", \"multiple_faces\": \"Yes\", \"no_faces\": 2, \"wears_mask\": [\"No\", \"No\"], \"age\": [27, 28], \"gender\": [\"Man\", \"Man\"], \"race\": [\"asian\", None], \"emotion\": [\"angry\", \"neutral\"], \"emotion (category)\": [\"Negative\", \"Neutral\"]`, where for the two faces that are detected (given by `no_faces`), some of the values are returned as a list with the first item for the first (largest) face and the second item for the second (smaller) face (for example, `\"emotion\"` returns a list `[\"angry\", \"neutral\"]` signifying the first face expressing anger, and the second face having a neutral expression).\n",
    "\n",
    "The emotion detection reports the seven facial expressions angry, fear, neutral, sad, disgust, happy and surprise. These emotions are assigned based on the returned confidence of the model (between 0 and 1), with a high confidence signifying a high likelihood of the detected emotion being correct. Emotion recognition is not an easy task, even for a human; therefore, we have added a keyword `emotion_threshold` signifying the % value above which an emotion is counted as being detected. The default is set to 50%, so that a confidence above 0.5 results in an emotion being assigned. If the confidence is lower, no emotion is assigned. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the seven facial expressions, an overall dominating emotion category is identified: negative, positive, or neutral emotion. These are defined with the facial expressions angry, disgust, fear and sad for the negative category, happy for the positive category, and surprise and neutral for the neutral category.\n",

    "For even better results, a slightly different approach has been prepared that can improve search results. It is quite resource-intensive, so it is applied after the main algorithm has found the most relevant images. This approach works only with text queries and it skips image queries. Among the parameters you can choose 3 models: `\"blip_base\"`, `\"blip_large\"`, `\"blip2_coco\"`. If you get an `Out of Memory` error, try reducing the batch_size value (minimum = 1), which is the number of images being processed simultaneously. With the parameter `need_grad_cam = True/False` you can enable the calculation of the heat map of each image to be processed and save them in `image_gradcam_with_itm`. Thus the `image_text_match_reordering()` function calculates new similarity values and new ranks for each image. The resulting values are added to the general dictionary."
